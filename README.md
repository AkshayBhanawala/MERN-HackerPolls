# [Hacker Polls [MERN]](https://th3az-mern-hackerpolls.herokuapp.com)
An app that I build for an online challenge.
Users can vote from the users available on the system, or they can register themself if they can talk admin into registering them. \
Admin Login and User login are there. \
Each user can vote only once including Admin. \
Admin can add user and delete user from the system. \
Users can edit only self details, even Admin can only edit self details. \
Not logged in users can also vote once, Uniqueness is checked by their IP address. \
If logged in, both IP and User, are restricted to vote again. \
Edit operation allows user to add/remove expertise details and rate/unrate themself on it.
